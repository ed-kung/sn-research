\section{Hypotheses} \label{sec_hypotheses}

Based on the above discussion, we test the following hypotheses regarding user behavior on Stacker News. 

\begin{hyp}
Higher posting costs lead to fewer posts, but higher quality posts.
\end{hyp}
\begin{hyp}
When a post is highly zapped, the creator will subsequently produce similar content.
\end{hyp}
\begin{hyp}
Consistently unprofitable users are more likely to leave the platform.
\end{hyp}
\begin{hyp}
The quality of discourse is higher than on platforms without financial micro-incentives.
\end{hyp}

Together, the hypotheses would suggest that the incentive structures built into Stacker News are effective at increasing the quality of discourse on the platform.
