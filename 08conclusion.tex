\section{Conclusion} \label{sec_conclusion}

Our analysis of Stacker News data confirms three central hypotheses: first, that posting costs can increase the quality of posted content, consistent with signaling theory; second, that the potential to be rewarded with tips also leads users to post better content over time; and third, that unprofitable users are more likely to leave the platform while profitable users are more likely to stay. This third point suggests that content quality may further increase over time as poor quality users, such as bots or trolls, eventually leave the platform.

More broadly speaking, the results suggest that users of internet discussion platforms are responsive to financial micro-incentives, even ones of very small monetary value. Equipping a discussion platform with the proper incentive structures may therefore be an effective method to improve the quality of content and discourse on the platform, leading to fewer poor quality posts, more original content, and more respectful content. 

Moreover, the incentive structures on Stacker News are only made possible by the ability of the Lightning Network to instantaneously process small micropayments across a global network of users. This highlights a very clear and compelling use case for the utility of Bitcoin.
