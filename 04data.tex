\section{Data} \label{sec_data}

To test these hypotheses, we downloaded a snapshot of the Stacker News database on \gn{EndDate}. The data covers the time period from \gn{StartDate} to \gn{EndDate} and contains \gn{NumPosts} posts and \gn{NumComments} comments (replies), for a total of \gn{NumItems} items posted by \gn{NumUsers} users across \gn{NumTerritories} territories. Over this time period, users zapped each other \gn{TotalZaps} sats and paid \gn{TotalCost} sats in posting fees. 

In addition to the Stacker News data, we downloaded daily Bitcoin price data from CoinMarketCap.com. At the time of writing, the price of one Bitcoin is approximately 100,000 USD, which would make 1,000 sats worth approximately \$1. This is a useful rule of thumb for converting between sats and dollars when trying to evaluate the economic significance of Stacker News micropayments.
