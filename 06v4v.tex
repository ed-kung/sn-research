\section{Value-for-value incentives and content quality}\label{sec_v4v}

We now consider our second hypothesis: that the types of content better rewarded by zaps will increase in prevalence over time as users learn that these kinds of content are better rewarded.

To test this hypothesis, we first need a method for categorizing posts into different quality types. Although many classification schemes could be considered, we opted for the simplest approach of a binary classification into ``high quality'' and ``low quality'' posts based on transparently observable content characteristics. The simple and transparent classification scheme assists with the interpretability of the results.

We label posts as ``high'' or ``low'' quality based on three easily observable post characteristics: the number of words in the post, whether the post body contains images or links, and whether the post is a ``link post''. On Stacker News, there are two main types of posts: ``discussion posts'' and ``link posts''. There is no difference between the two in terms of costs. The only technical difference between a link post and a discussion post is that a link post contains a URL next to the title of the post. Users of Stacker News generally consider link posts to be of lower quality than discussion posts because link posts usually reference someone else's work and is less likely to contain original content. The most common type of post on Stacker News is a link post with no text in the post body, i.e. a post that points to another URL with no additional commentary. Users \emph{can} add text to the body of a link post. The most common reasons for doing this are to add quotations from the linked URL (to preview the linked content), or to add the user's own commentary regarding the linked URL. When users add their own commentary, link posts tend to be better rewarded than if the user only adds quotations or if the user doesn't add any text to the post body.

In contrast to a link post, a discussion post does not link to a URL. Discussion posts are usually original content from the poster. There is a wide range of discussion posts: commentary, essays, fiction, poetry, book and movie reviews, discussion questions, and more. Discussion posts tend to be better rewarded than link posts because they contain more of the poster's original thoughts.
