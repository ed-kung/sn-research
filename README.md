This is the public repository for my research project, **Financial micro-incentives and internet discourse: Evidence from a Bitcoin based discussion platform**, joint with Keyan Kousha of Stacker News.

I am conducting this research in public, which is how I envision all future research should be done. All code is public and verifiable. The data is not publicly available, but you can view the schema [here](https://github.com/stackernews/stacker.news/blob/master/prisma/schema.prisma) (you may have to find the commit on the date of the data extraction, which was October 5, 2025). 

Every once in a while I post updates on the progress of the project. You can find a list of such posts [here](https://stacker.news/SimpleStacker#research-in-public).
